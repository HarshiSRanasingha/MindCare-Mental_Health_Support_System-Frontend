# Mental Health Support System 

## 📌 Project Title
Mental Health Support System for Students

##  Problem Description
Mental health issues among students are increasing rapidly due to academic pressure, personal problems, social anxiety, depression, stress, and other emotional challenges. Many students hesitate to seek help because of fear, stigma, lack of privacy, or limited access to counselors.

Traditional counseling systems are often inefficient and difficult to access quickly. Students may feel uncomfortable discussing their issues openly or may not know how to contact professional support services.

As a result, many students suffer silently without receiving proper mental health assistance.


## 💡 Proposed Solution
The MERN Mental Health Support System is a web-based platform developed to provide students with a secure, simple, and private way to request counseling support.

The system allows:
- Students to submit mental health support requests
- Counselors to manage and respond to requests
- Organized storage of counseling records using MongoDB
- Efficient communication between students and counselors

The platform is developed using the MERN stack:
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js

This solution improves accessibility, privacy, and management of mental health support services.
